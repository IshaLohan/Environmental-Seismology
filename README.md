# Environmental-Seismology
Summer 2021 IISc Bengaluru

During my bachelor's summer internship at the Center for Earth Sciences, IISc, Bengaluru, in 2021, I did a literature review on Environmental Seismology.
Mainly Glacial, Fluvial, Volcano Seismology and Microseism were covered. A few of those ppts are added here.
The only purpose of sharing ppts is to share knowledge.
I tried my best not to miss any references, but if I missed any I am sorry for it and would be happy to receive feedback.
